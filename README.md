CLASS OVERVIEW: 
Welcome to Gender and Engineering 303 – Online Asynchronous course
All Genders Building Collaboration and Innovation in the Engineering Workplace
This course is an interactive course drawing on research in social linguistics, crosscultural understanding, business practices, and the instructors and students’ real workplace scenarios regarding gender differences in the engineering workplace.
It provides a foundation for managing the different worlds - the different cultural lenses and paradigms - ultimately different competencies, communication, and leadership styles, the genders bring to an engineering workplace.
Effective communication and management of differences minimizes firefighting and increases productivity, customer focus, innovation, development, and marketing of products, as well as improves the advancement of both women and men as well as people across the gender spectrum.
The major learning objectives are that by the end of this course, students will be able to…·   Discuss diversity and inclusion within engineering, explaining where we want to be, where we are today, and why it matters.·   Roll-model communication and collaboration skills necessary for engaging with diverse stakeholders.·   Represent themselves as leaders and advocates, applying the class learnings to real-world business situations.
INSTRUCTOR: 
I am your instructor, Carol Lee Cobb. I have a Computer Engineering degree and I’ve worked for huge corporations and small start-ups. I have had many roles, from compatibility validation engineer, to salesperson, and technical assistant to a Vice President. I’ll talk more about my experiences during class. Feel free to link with me at www.linkedin.com/in/CarolLeeCobb. I may have contacts at companies where you’d like to work, and I might be able to facilitate informational interviews.
We may be joined in Canvas “Discussion” assignments by Bonita Banducci, who developed the original version of this course, continues to teach other sections, and has decades of experience as a business consultant through her company Banducci Consulting and www.GenderWork.com. We are working together to offer more sections. Together we are a powerful combination.
My philosophy is that we can all learn from each other, so I encourage participation and questions. Did you notice something related to our class this past week among your friends, at school, on the news? Then share it with us in the weekly Discussion assignment or on our 303 general discussion page.
I will “have your back”—meaning I will support you with any challenges, so the class will work for you, and in turn, I ask that you “have my back” meaning let me know if you notice something I could improve or do to support you and all of us in learning together.
OFFICE HOURS: By advance appointment, on zoom, phone, or in person. I'd love to meet you!
Calendly: Schedule a meeting. 
Many afternoons I work in SCDI in the open offices near 4025-11 (back door of the 4025 office, close to the library wall).

1st Discussion post due

And · Any papers, annotations, or quizzes due 
Each week there will be material to read or videos to watch, plus three activities. Some weeks this would be two discussions and one journal annotation. Other weeks it might be a discussion, journal annotation, and short quiz. And then other weeks it might be a discussion, short reflection paper, and journal annotation, etc. I may choose to make some of these weekly assignments optional, such as you pick to do 2 of the 3.
I try to keep the estimated workload to 3 hours per week. Please contact me if you see major discrepancies in the workload. 
Feel free to provide ad-hoc feedback to me along the way, but I also have a more formal survey in week 5, where I request feedback from you on how the class is going – anything about the process of the course that I should modify to make it more effective, etc.
